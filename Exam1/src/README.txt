This exam was an hour and a half long, and I was only docked points for using a return code rather than throwing an exception.
Account includes an ID, time created, balance, interest rate, customer identifiers and records a 
list of transactions to represent a bank account. Account was also able to display a list of all transactions for the account.

Checking Account and Savings accounts differ in that the checking can be overdrawn to a certain amount, 
which in a real-world application would likely result in a fee on the user's account
Alternatively, a savings account can withdraw more money than is available

In this exam, the main method in Bank.java, was where I wrote tests for the code. Testing various constructors as well as transactions.

In a real-world application, more security would have been necessary. Additionally, banks must comply with laws and their policies.
For example, some might flag large transactions in a short period of time or money frequently entering and exiting an account. 
It may be useful to record metadata about accounts which can then be analyzed, without having direct access to the accounts.
