Each employee type has different payment requirements
  HourlyEmployee.java
  SalariedEmployee.java
  CommissionEmployee.java
  BasePlusCommissionEmployee.java
There is also a main class where a user can enter information to create an employee type
This data is then added to instances of employee, where operations such as increasing commission percent, or adding a raise can be done

For future applications of this program, it could take in or output a .csv file with this information to help with payroll
Or base information about pay could be backed up to a database and updated when an employee receives a pay raise or increased commission percentage.
